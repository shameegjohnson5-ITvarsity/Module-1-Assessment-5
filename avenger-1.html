                <h3>About Thor</h3>
                <p>Thor Odinson is the God of Thunder, a member of the race known as the Asgardians, a group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal. Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and King of Asgard. He was worshiped by the humans known as Vikings and became part of Norse mythology. Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir, which helps him to channel his godly energies, he became the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms. When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to Midgard (more commonly known as Earth) as a disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake, stripped of his memory. After learning humility, he regained his memory as well as his godly powers. Thor went on to become a champion for Midgard as well as one of the founding members of the Avengers, "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".</p>

                <p>Thor is the blood-son of Odin, All-Father of the Asgardians, and Jord, who was also known as Gaea, the earth-goddess who was one of the Elder Gods. Odin claimed that he sought to father a son whose power would derive from both Asgard and Midgard (as the Earth realm is called by Asgardians), and hence he sought to mate with Jord. Odin created a cave in Norway where Jord gave birth to Thor. Months after the infant Thor was weaned, Odin brought him to Asgard to be raised. Odin's wife, the goddess Frigga, acted as Thor's mother from that time onward, and for many years Thor believed her to be his birthmother. Not until many centuries later did Thor learn the purported truth that Jord was his birth mother, though the Phoenix has asserted that Odin had lied about Thor's parentage and that it was his birth mother through Firehair, an ancient human mutant and avatar of the Phoenix Force, claiming that Gaea was a lie to ensure that Thor would dedicate himself to protecting the Earth. In truth, Gaea was Thor's birth mother, with the Phoenix acting as her midwife, but when the newborn Thor was assassinated by King Laufey the Phoenix resurrected him, leaving him permanently imbued with some of her power.</p>
